# Facebook Post Engagement Analysis with Python

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a Facebook page’s post-level dataset. The goal is to understand how different types of posts, timings, and content formats influence audience reach and engagement.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains metrics from a cosmetic brand’s Facebook page, including:

- Post type (e.g., Photo, Status, Link, Video)
- Post publish timing
- Lifetime post reach and engagement
- Number of likes, shares, and comments
- Impressions and consumer interactions

### Objective

To analyze post performance and uncover patterns that contribute to higher engagement and visibility. Key questions include:

- What post types get the most engagement?
- Which days and times are best for posting?
- What metrics most influence reach and user actions?

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Analyses Performed

- **Time-Based Analysis**:
  - Compared post performance on weekdays vs weekends
  - Analyzed post timing impact on reach

- **Content-Type Insights**:
  - Engagement performance by post type (Photo, Video, etc.)
  - Top-performing formats

- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Heatmaps to visualize relationships among key metrics
  - Identified strong predictors of high engagement

## Key Insights

- **Photo posts** consistently outperform other types in user interactions.
- **Weekday posts** generally lead to higher reach and engagement.
- Strong correlations observed between **reach, likes, shares**, and **impressions**.
- Posting during certain **time windows** increases visibility.

## Conclusion

This analysis offers actionable insights for improving social media strategy. It helps identify the optimal content type, timing, and engagement drivers that can enhance a Facebook page’s performance.
